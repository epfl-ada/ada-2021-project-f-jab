So, we had access to everything in the archive, which turned out to be super helpful. So, yeah, the original trilogy was on our table for the flashback and for audio. That said, Leia was a very different person in the new trilogy, and I'm not sure that we would've used any audio from the original trilogy.

That combination, I believe, still has enormous amounts of exploration, and I find that very exciting, that neither technology is necessarily strongest, I believe on its own.
