    "We take inspiration from the way [this article/post](#https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-produce-an-animated-bar-plot-in-plotly-using-python-2b5b360492f8) uses plotly express to generate animated bar plots that changes based on year. We will however modify it to our approach and start by expressing the approach using auxiliary functions, that are import from the auxiliary python script, `plotly_aux.py`"

          "I want to clarify my interview on the `Charlie Rose Show.' It was for the Kennedy Center Honors and conducted prior to the premiere of the film. I misspoke and used a very inappropriate analogy and for that I apologize. I have been working with Disney for 40 years and chose them as the custodians of Star Wars because of my great respect for the company and Bob Iger's leadership. Disney is doing an incredible job of taking care of and expanding the franchise. I rarely go out with statements to clarify my feelings but I feel it is important to make it clear that I am thrilled that Disney has the franchise and is moving it in such exciting directions in film, television and the parks. Most of all I'm blown away with the record breaking blockbuster success of the new movie and am very proud of JJ and Kathy.",
          "They were saying, `Well, since when has Star Wars been just for the boys? '",
          "When it became clear what this story was and where `Episode VIII' and `Episode IX' would go, the end of this movie was very much intended to be a cliffhanger.",
          "It's the third one, and I think that's pushing it a bit too far. The plot was unfolding rather well, and I think it was a bit unnecessary. In Star Wars, and Return Of The Jedi, it was a tidy way to end things, with the David And Goliath-style battle, and they've done that again. That was the only thing that stuck in my throat.",
          "When I started to go into Star Wars, [ my friends ] said, `Why are you making a children's film? '",

          "We became friends and then we started dating and he didn't freak out at the action figures that I had on my wall. So he sort of knew from the get-go that he was going to have to accept it that I love Star Wars and he became a fan,",

          "Indeed, all the spoilers I could throw at you right now -- but I won't, I promise -- would seem familiar, because the whole damn movie seems obsessively and insistently familiar. We have known for months or years that The Force Awakens would be a massive worldwide hit, and that would still be true even if it turned out to be about Jar Jar Binks and the Little Mermaid going on an underwater quest for the essence of Gangnam Style. It's the Citibank of movies, literally too big to fail. But Abrams has grander ambitions than a Michael Bay-style cash grab. His mission is to build a new Star Wars franchise on top of the old one, and the ultimate success of that venture will largely depend on how the series' millions of fans react to the fact that he hasn't just made a movie fueled by nostalgia, or a movie full of mythic echoes. He's made a movie they've already seen, a simulacrum of something that was already a simulacrum of something else.",

Star Wars is the only kind of movie where somebody can just yell, `Noooooooo!' and you're with it. So to do a movie that gets to that level of pure, human-heart-ripped-out emotion -- I felt like that was the right thing to do.",

          "There are few movies, if any, in history that can claim to have an iconic status similar to that of Star Wars. Its universal content appeals and entertains fans across ages. As the franchise is new to Indian audiences, we decided to start our marketing and brand associations and activations almost a year in advance. Our Consumer Products team has worked hard to get a record number of brand partners on board for the film.

Most celebrities do take the high road thanks to their publicist, but I was watching someone like Carrie Fisher recently who addressed how someone made a comment about the way she looks and how she aged in Star Wars, and she came back with the most brilliant response.",

          "I remember watching TV. I was six years old and there was a Star Wars movie promo. Something captured me. The fantasy element, I think. There were these weird characters and robots and aliens, and it was this super space adventure. I remember telling my dad, I have to see this movie. When we finally went to he movie theater, I remember the line going around the block two or three times. That was a bigger-than-life experience for me. It was something unique.",

We enjoyed evenings of music and dance in our bar with the cast and crew. Mark Hamill even learned how to pull a pint with our barman, Ciaran Kelly!",

          "I don't even have to think about it. You have to go the traditional route. You begin with Star Wars, then The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. I grew up watching those films, and I just believe that the order that they were released is the only way to watch them.",

          "It was the movie that should have been made after the first `Star Wars' films! It is so fun and it's got exactly the right note.

The only reason why Kylo Ren has any hope of being a worthy successor is because we lose one of the most beloved characters. Long before we had this title, the idea of The Force Awakens was that this would become the evolution of not just a hero, but a villain - and not a villain who was the finished, ready-made villain, but someone who was in process. As a father, as a friend to people who have children, I know what it's like to see struggle, to be part of struggle. I know how painful it can be. I know how real it is. And this is, of course, an insane extrapolated version. It's this massive tradeoff: how can we possibly do that!? But... if we hadn't done that, the movie wouldn't have any guts at all.

Disney wanted to release a `Star Wars' `saga' film every two years, and there was no way Abrams could have handled both projects when the post-production of one overlapped with the pre-production of the other. In fact, the workload for `The Force Awakens' was so heavy, its opening was delayed from `Star War `s' traditional May opening month to December.

And it would seem to me that the conclusion I have come to is that all of the religions are true; they just see a different part of the elephant. Religion is basically a container for faith. Faith is the glue that holds us together as a society. Faith in our culture, our world -- whatever it is we are trying to hang on to. It is a very important part allowing us to remain stable -- remain balanced.",

          "And yet The Force Awakens adds up to something less than the sum of its parts. The early scenes have a relaxed, assured pace. But as the story moves forward, Abrams becomes more mired in the task of keeping the plot mechanics in gear. There's the expected climactic battle between X-wing starfighters and TIE fighters, which is mildly exciting and nothing more -- the fact that it's punctuated with dumb dialogue like `General! Their shields are down!' `Prepare to fire!' and even the classic, `It would take a miracle to save us now,' surely doesn't help. And the movie's big twist, clearly intended to be a moment of Shakespearean grandeur, is handled clumsily: Instead of allowing a significant figure to have his grand moment, Abrams cuts to other characters expressing shock and dismay, as if he didn't trust the audience to know what to feel.",

And especially after losing the battle against filming `The Force Awakens' in England (he didn't want to have to move his family there during filming), he understandably wanted to take a break. Disney wanted to release a `Star Wars' `saga' film every two years, and there was no way Abrams could have handled both projects when the post-production of one overlapped with the pre-production of the other. In fact, the workload for `The Force Awakens' was so heavy, its opening was delayed from `Star War's' traditional May opening month to December.

He combines the world building (and world destroying) of the first film, its Second World War -- like aerial combat and anti-fascist derring-do, with the psychodynamics of the second one.... Without the careful buildup that Irvin Kershner gave the series-altering revelations in The Empire Strikes Back, the dramaturgy becomes stilted and the dialogue bland, not powerfully archetypal. Nothing can leech the zip from a performer quicker than an overblown lament for a child gone wrong. And nothing can stop a movie dead in its tracks like errant sentimentality. In The Wild Bunch, Pike Bishop [ played by William Holden ] had the sardonic wisdom to declare:' 10,000 [ dollars ] cuts a lot of family ties.'

          "The Luke Skywalker lightsaber from the original 1977 film was made from a vintage Graflex camera flash. It had seven plastic grips attached to the handle, and a Texas Instruments Exactra calculator LED bubblestrip. When the lightsaber returns in The Empire Strikes Back, it only has six grips on the handle, and each grip had a notch cut out to accommodate a visible fastener. Additionally, the bubblestrip had been replaced by a vintage computer connector board. The Force Awakens trailer once again features the same lightsaber, still with the correct vintage computer board, and still with the notches cut out of the handle grips -- as we last saw them. However, it is unclear as to whether there are six or seven grips on the handle. Can you please confirm whether The Force Awakens Luke Skywalker lightsaber has six, or seven, grips?",

          "Preview of Star Wars: Obi-Wan and Anakin # 1",
          "With my son, my plan had always been to show him the films in the order in which they were made. Even though I enjoy the prequels (well, two of them), I wanted him to experience the films the way I did. But I showed him Star Wars (a.k.a. Episode IV, a.k.a.. A New Hope) when he was around 4, and, aside from a couple of scenes, he was bored. So, a few months later, we started again, this time with The Phantom Menace... and he was totally enraptured. He loved Anakin. He loved Qui-gon. He loved Darth Maul. He wanted to see the scene where Anakin met Padme over and over again. He loved the underwater scenes. He loved the speeder race. (Thank the Lord he didn't care at all for Jar Jar.) Who was this strange kid who loved The Phantom Menace so much?! We moved on to Attack of the Clones, and then the first half of Sith. He had become so taken with Anakin -- even grown-up Hayden Christiansen Anakin -- that I didn't have the heart to show him the dark ending of that film. After that, we moved on to Episode IV. After THAT, we showed him the finale of Sith. Then, Empire and Jedi. Ultimately, the prequels had more of an impact on him than the original trilogy... except, oddly enough, Return of the Jedi. All along, I was surprised to discover that he was less interested in the kiddie stuff like Jar Jar and the Ewoks, and more taken with the drama of Anakin and the Dark Side and Luke. If there are two sequences in the whole series that he's probably watched the most, it's the final fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan in Sith, and the one between Vader and Luke in Jedi. But all this was over a year and a half ago, so he doesn't remember it all that well. To prepare him for The Force Awakens, I've shown him Star Wars again (Episode IV), which he enjoyed much more this time around. I haven't decided yet if we'll move on to Empire and Jedi before we leap into The Force Awakens. I kind of don't want him to fall in love with [ SPOILER REDACTION ].",

He's the most generous and gentle and sweet and thoughtful person I think I've met. He's really just like a dream human being who doesn't quite act like accomplished anything, meaning his modesty is so true and pure. He talks just like anyone might, but he's also had maybe the biggest imprint or impact on American film than anyone period. He's so sweet and modest and it's so genuine and who he is, it shows you how you can accomplish extraordinary things and not walk around like you've accomplished extraordinary things.

It was for the Kennedy Center Honors and conducted prior to the premiere of the film. I misspoke and used a very inappropriate analogy and for that I apologize. I have been working with Disney for 40 years and chose them as the custodians of Star Wars because of my great respect for the company and Bob Iger's leadership. Disney is doing an incredible job of taking care of and expanding the franchise. I rarely go out with statements to clarify my feelings but I feel it is important to make it clear that I am thrilled that Disney has the franchise and is moving it in such exciting directions in film, television and the parks. Most of all I'm blown away with the record breaking blockbuster success of the new movie and am very proud of JJ and Kathy.\",\"They were saying, `Well, since when has Star Wars been just for the boys? '\",\"When it became clear what this story was and where `Episode VIII' and `Episode IX' would go, the end of this movie was very much intended to be a cliffhanger.\",\"It's the third one, and I think that's pushing it a bit too far. The plot was unfolding rather well, and I think it was a bit unnecessary. In Star Wars, and Return Of The Jedi, it was a tidy way to end things, with the David And Goliath-style battle, and they've done that again. That was the only thing that stuck in my throat.\",\"When I started to go into Star Wars, [ my friends ] said, `Why are you making a children's film? '\",\"But they are unlikely to match the might of the core Star Wars films at the box office.\",\"Dilwale overseas: Gulf -- biggest-ever opening for a Bollywood film, and the number one film this weekend, higher than Star Wars: The Force Awakens and other films,\",\"Star Wars movies are meant to be a couple of hours of diversion from reality, and we need that. They are optimistic and hopeful stories. But in comparison to what we can do with this [ the hospital ], last night [ the Star Wars premiere ] is very trivial.\",\"We became friends and then we started dating and he didn't freak out at the action figures that I had on my wall. So he sort of knew from the get-go that he was going to have to accept it that I love Star Wars and he became a fan,\",\"I am fan of `Star Wars' . I am excited about the film. I am keen to watch the film. All the best to the team. May the force be with you,\",\"That was really the beginning of the discussion. The answer was the kind of sense of discovery, exhilaration and surprise. The comedy that George Lucas put into Star Wars kind of was, for me, the thing that made me love the movie,\",\"I'm most excited because my dad took me to go see the original Star Wars movie back in 1977. It's the first memory I have,\",\"I made a promise to my friend that I wouldn't see Star Wars until I got home to L.A.. We're going to one of those theaters with the reclining chairs where you can order food. It's going to be a whole deal.\",\"Propelled and inspired all of the cast and crew of the original Star Wars trilogy.\",\"I mean, anything Star Wars has my vote, but the looks that Pat McGrath did and the products that came out of the collaboration are my favorite thing.

Long before we had this title, the idea of The Force Awakens was that this would become the evolution of not just a hero, but a villain - and not a villain who was the finished, ready-made villain, but someone who was in process. As a father, as a friend to people who have children, I know what it's like to see struggle, to be part of struggle. I know how painful it can be. I know how real it is.

Disney wanted to release a `Star Wars' `saga' film every two years, and there was no way Abrams could have handled both projects when the post-production of one overlapped with the pre-production of the other. In fact, the workload for `The Force Awakens' was so heavy, its opening was delayed from `Star War `s' traditional May opening month to December.

When I was 10 years old, I asked my mother, I said, Well, if there is only one God, why are there so many religions? And over the years I have been pondering that question ever since. And it would seem to me that the conclusion I have come to is that all of the religions are true; they just see a different part of the elephant. Religion is basically a container for faith. Faith is the glue that holds us together as a society. Faith in our culture, our world -- whatever it is we are trying to hang on to. It is a very important part allowing us to remain stable -- remain balanced.\",\"Live, from Manchester, New Hampshire, this is the third Democratic debate.

But as the story moves forward, Abrams becomes more mired in the task of keeping the plot mechanics in gear. There's the expected climactic battle between X-wing starfighters and TIE fighters, which is mildly exciting and nothing more -- the fact that it's punctuated with dumb dialogue like `General! Their shields are down!' `Prepare to fire!' and even the classic, `It would take a miracle to save us now,' surely doesn't help. And the movie's big twist, clearly intended to be a moment of Shakespearean grandeur, is handled clumsily: Instead of allowing a significant figure to have his grand moment, Abrams cuts to other characters expressing shock and dismay, as if he didn't trust the audience to know what to feel.\",\"With a movie like Star Wars coming out, it's just massively busy,\",\"Star Wars captured my imagination as a child, and I still love it today.

And especially after losing the battle against filming `The Force Awakens' in England (he didn't want to have to move his family there during filming), he understandably wanted to take a break. Disney wanted to release a `Star Wars' `saga' film every two years, and there was no way Abrams could have handled both projects when the post-production of one overlapped with the pre-production of the other. In fact, the workload for `The Force Awakens' was so heavy, its opening was delayed from `Star War's' traditional May opening month to December.

Without the careful buildup that Irvin Kershner gave the series-altering revelations in The Empire Strikes Back, the dramaturgy becomes stilted and the dialogue bland, not powerfully archetypal. Nothing can leech the zip from a performer quicker than an overblown lament for a child gone wrong. And nothing can stop a movie dead in its tracks like errant sentimentality.

Every year there are a great many weird albums that sell nothing and brilliant movies make less than $50 million.

Even though I enjoy the prequels (well, two of them), I wanted him to experience the films the way I did. But I showed him Star Wars (a.k.a. Episode IV, a.k.a.. A New Hope) when he was around 4, and, aside from a couple of scenes, he was bored. So, a few months later, we started again, this time with The Phantom Menace... and he was totally enraptured. He loved Anakin. He loved Qui-gon. He loved Darth Maul. He wanted to see the scene where Anakin met Padme over and over again. He loved the underwater scenes. He loved the speeder race. (Thank the Lord he didn't care at all for Jar Jar.) Who was this strange kid who loved The Phantom Menace so much?! We moved on to Attack of the Clones, and then the first half of Sith. He had become so taken with Anakin -- even grown-up Hayden Christiansen Anakin -- that I didn't have the heart to show him the dark ending of that film. After that, we moved on to Episode IV. After THAT, we showed him the finale of Sith. Then, Empire and Jedi. Ultimately, the prequels had more of an impact on him than the original trilogy... except, oddly enough, Return of the Jedi. All along, I was surprised to discover that he was less interested in the kiddie stuff like Jar Jar and the Ewoks, and more taken with the drama of Anakin and the Dark Side and Luke. If there are two sequences in the whole series that he's probably watched the most, it's the final fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan in Sith, and the one between Vader and Luke in Jedi. But all this was over a year and a half ago, so he doesn't remember it all that well. To prepare him for The Force Awakens, I've shown him Star Wars again (Episode IV), which he enjoyed much more this time around.

Fan films-whether related to Star Trek, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Power Rangers, Batman or any other franchise - are labors of love that keep fans engaged, entertained, and keep favorite characters alive in the hearts of fans. Like other current fan films, AXANAR entered production based on a very long history and relationship between fandom and studios. We're not doing anything new here. Like all fan films, AXANAR is a love letter to a beloved franchise. For nearly 50 years, Star Trek's devotees have been creating new Star Trek stories to share with fellow fans.
